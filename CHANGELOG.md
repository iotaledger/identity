## [v0.5.0-dev.1](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/v0.5.0-dev.1) (2021-12-15)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0-dev.1)
 
This release introduces multiple breaking changes to the structure of IOTA DID Documents and their Tangle messages, rendering any identity created with a prior version incompatible and unresolvable. A versioning system has been introduced so any new identities should hopefully be forward compatible with any future breaking changes to the message structure.
