 This example shows how to create a Verifiable Presentation and validate it.
 A Verifiable Presentation is the format in which a (collection of) Verifiable Credential(s) gets shared.
 It is signed by the subject, to prove control over the Verifiable Credential with a nonce or timestamp.

    // Let us now look at a couple of ways that a verifier can validate the presentation 

    // ===========================================================================
    // Validation using the Resolver directly  
    // ===========================================================================
    
    // The Resolver can conveniently validate presentations. By default it checks
    // the following:
    // the holder's signature (with default options)
    // The signatures on the credentials in the presentation and that their expiry date is not in the past
    // and their issuance dates are not in the future. 
    
    // There are however situations where one would like to tweak these settings somewhat however.
    // Suppose for instance that  the verifier wants to check that the challenge matches, 
    // that the holder is always the subject of any credentials in the presentation 
    // and that said credentials do not expire within the next 10 hours. This can be done using 
    // `PresentationValidationOptions` as follows: 

    // Declare that the challenge must match our expectation: 
    const presentationVerifierOptions = new VerifierOptions( {
        challenge: "475a7984-1bb5-4c4c-a56f-822bccd46440", 
    });

    // Declare that any credential contained in the presentation are not allowed to expire within the next 10 hours:
    const earliestExpiryDate = Timestamp.nowUTC().checkedAdd(Duration.hours(10));
    const credentialValidationOptions = new CredentialValidationOptions( {
        earliestExpiryDate: earliestExpiryDate,
    });

    // Declare that the presentation's holder must always be the subject of a credential in the presentation. 
    const subjectHolderRelationship = SubjectHolderRelationship.AlwaysSubject; 

    const presentationValidationOptions = new PresentationValidationOptions( {
        sharedValidationOptions: credentialValidationOptions,
        presentationVerifierOptions: presentationVerifierOptions,
        subjectHolderRelationship: subjectHolderRelationship,
    });


    // Validate the presentation and all the credentials included in it according to the validation options 
    await resolver.verifyPresentation(
        presentation,
        presentationValidationOptions,
        FailFast.FirstError
    );
    // Since no errors were thrown by `verifyPresentation` we know that the validation was successful. 
    console.log(`Successful VP validation using the Resolver`);

    // Note that the `verifyPresentation` method we called automatically resolved all DID Documents that are necessary to validate the presentation. 
    // It is also possible to supply extra arguments to avoid some resolutions if one already has up-to-date resolved documents of 
    // either the holder or issuers (see the method's documentation).
