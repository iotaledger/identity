# credential-revocation

Notifying a holder that a previously issued credential has been revoked. Note that this revocation is declaratory, not constitutive, so the actual revocation has to be done elsewhere (e.g. in the backend of the issuer).

### Roles
- <u>**Issuer**</u>: Agent who revokes the credential
- <u>**Holder**</u>: Agent who holds the credential to be revoked

### Flow

![credential-revocation flow](./img/credential-revocation.png)

### Messages

#### revocation
The <u>issuer</u> sends the `revocation` to the <u>holder</u>, notifying him of the revocation. The most important field here is `credentialId`, which specifies the credential that has been revoked.
