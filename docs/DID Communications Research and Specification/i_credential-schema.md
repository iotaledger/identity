# credential-schema
Querying an agent for the schema of a specific VC that the agent can issue.

The Verifiable Credential (VC) issuance flow consists of a three step interaction process ([credential-options](i_credential-options.md), [credential-schema](i_credential-schema.md) & [credential-issuance](i_credential-issuance.md) between two parties, the <u>issuer</u> and the <u>holder</u>. This is the second interaction in this process. In this interaction, the <u>holder</u> queries the <u>issuer</u> for the precise schema of one of the VCs that the <u>issuer</u> offers to issue, with it's own list of requirements which must be satisfied by the <u>holder</u> in order to qualify for the credential.

### Roles
- **Issuer**: Agent who offers and issues one or more Verifiable Credentials
- **Holder**: Agent who selects and receives one or more Verifiable Credentials
