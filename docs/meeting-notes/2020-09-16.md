### Stronghold Integration
Every signing process with crypto keys should be done in Stronghold. Stronghold should not release private keys.

Example: 
- identity.rs -> stronghold.rs = Hey, can u please sign this message with XYZ algorithm?
- stronghold.rs -> identity.rs => Sure, here is the signed message.


identity.rs needs to be very flexible with crypto algorithms. 

- stronghold has a fixed amount of crypto algorithms.
- identity have to allow that people can use their own crypto algorithms.



### Account Module

Uses the account module stronghold or does it also include logic and act as a higher level library?  

Could be splitted in two parts:
- logic for stronghold
- logic for tangle

The identity.rs account module should be similar to [IOTA Accounts](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/1.1/accounts/overview).

[IOTA accounts](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/1.1/accounts/overview) allow you to prove your ownership of IOTA tokens or messages.
