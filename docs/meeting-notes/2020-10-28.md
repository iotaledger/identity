## 🙋‍ Standup

### ⏪ What was last week's progress?
- Added `JcsEd25519Signature2020`, `IotaDID`, and `IotaDocument`. Added a very basic example of issuing/verifying a signed credential.
- Worked on Stronghold Client and added manual Diff implementation to the DID. 
- Get wasm working with iota
- Bring WASM further and prepared npm release
- Start working on a communication actor by using iotaledger/actors.rs

### ⏩ What will be the focus this week?
- Defines "higher level lib" methods for WASM binding
- Continue work on Stronghold

## 💬 Discussion topics
- Wasm iota and core lib together or only one? And what functionality do we want there?
- Schema's 
- Snapshotting questions (brought up in the discord chat)
- X-Teams starting next week
- Tensor code reviews
- ESP32 (see: https://mabez.dev/blog/posts/esp32-rust/)

### Wasm iota and core lib together or only one? And what functionality do we want there?

- Focus on IOTA bindings

### Schema's 

- Schema validation

Example Code: 
```rust
let credential: Credential = ...;
let schema: Value = reqwest::get("https://example.org/schema.json").await?.json()?;
let schema = json_schema::JSONSchema::compile(&schema, None)?;
let result = schema.validate(&credential.to_json_value()?);

println!("Schema Validation Result: {:#?}", result);
```


### Snapshotting questions

Ideas on how to stop DID documents from being destroyed by snapshotting on the tangle.

- Selective Permanode
- Identity Nodes (holds all identities)
- WASP Node (Smart Contract Solution, holds specific identites (contries, use cases, etc.))


### Use identity.rs on micro controllers like ESP32

How we handle errors?
- thiserror -> no std

Pasers could be a problem
- URL parser
- pest doesnt support no-std
- Timestamps (chrono)


What do we need for ESP32 working
- entrypoint which uses [no mangle]
- no-std

## Questions
Q1: Do we need both inputs here?

```rust=
pub fn new(did: IotaDID, authentication: PublicKey)
```

first line of the function
```rust=
Self::check_authentication_key_id(&authentication, &did)?;
```

A1: ~~No, we can extract `IotaDID` from `PublicKey`~~ Add a new constructor function

---

Q2: How to structure the WASM lib?

Option A: Everything in one lib (could get very big)
Option B: Every crate also gets a WASM binding 
    pro: flexible small WASM bindings
    contra: devs need to install and import many libs
Option C: Mixture of Option A and B. Wasm Bindings for Each lib and a high level WASM binding. 

A2: First use Option A - then C

---

Q3: How can we convert the JS input to a secretKey to sign the document?

Idea: dont expose key's

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct Key(KeyPair);

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl Key {
  #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
  pub fn new() -> Self {
    Self(IotaDocument::generate_ed25519_keypair())
  }

  #[wasm_bindgen(getter)]
  pub fn public(&self) -> String {
    encode_b58(self.0.public())
  }

  #[wasm_bindgen(getter)]
  pub fn secret(&self) -> String {
    encode_b58(self.0.secret())
  }
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct Document(IotaDocument);

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl Document {
  #[wasm_bindgen]
  pub fn sign(&mut self, key: &Key) {
    self.0.sign(key.secret());
  }
}
```

A3:

Q4: Can we make the errors compatible with https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/reference/types/result.html?

A4: Anyhow should support WASM. Some extra work will be required to make things a little less rough. Look into Console.panic hook and converting errors to strings and throwing exceptions.

---

Q5: Can we require that DIDs contain a network? Avoids the need to normalize and determine which address is original
```
did:iota:xyz == did:iota:main:xyz
```
A5: 

---

Q6: How do we generate diff chain addresses?

A6:
