### NPM Publsh Workflow

Name: @iota/identity
Run pipeline on: Main branch update

https://github.com/jbolda/covector


### Documentation

Setup Identity Documentation on Documentation Portal.

https://github.com/huhn511/documentation/tree/feat/identity/identity

Inspiration: https://didproject.azurewebsites.net/docs/overview.html

Please feel free to contribute! :)

### Versioning

The [Documentation Portal](https://docs.iota.org) has a versioning system. At the moment, it's not linked to IOTA product versioning.

Question:

Is it possible to "sync" the identity version to the Dokumentation Portal (Do we have some versions of rust and npm packages?)

Future improvements
- Push new version on releases
- Changelog
