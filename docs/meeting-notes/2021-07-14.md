## üë• Participants
- @JelleMillenaar
- @PhilippGackstatter
- @eike-hass
- @abdulmth
- @CraigBester
- @l1h3r

### ‚è™ What did you achieve last week?
- @JelleMillenaar: Opened Issues, Kanban boards, new projects, presentations, Identity for Things hardware
- @eike-hass: Small discussion with @abdulmth about docusaurus/REPL integration
- @CraigBester: added `publicKeyMultibase` support, investigating slow examples/tests, reading standards.
- @abdulmth: WASM Browser Examples, Docusaurus Example integration, Learning about identity standards. 
- @PhilippGackstatter: Impl async methods for the identity actor, get actor to compile to Wasm
- @l1h3r: Clean up examples, Refactor DID chains

### What did block you?
- @PhilippGackstatter: Errors aren't serializable, that's an issue for both networking and FFI, wasm-bindgen snippets don't (yet) work with nodejs :( making libp2p websocket transport unavailable there
- @CraigBester: circular dependency when updating iota.rs (iota-client) package, low-level examples throwing network errors after update
- 

### ‚è© What will be the focus this week?
- @abdulmth: documentaion migration to docusaurus. 
- @PhilippGackstatter: Get a Wasm PoC working for the identity actor
- @l1h3r: Finish refactoring DID chains, add account WASM bindings
- @JelleMillenaar: Finish planning 1.0, hardware, ZKP, Streams sync
- @CraigBester: investigate/fix slow examples/tests issues, start implementing `publicKeyJwk` afterwards
- 

## üí¨ Discussion topics
- @PhilippGackstatter: Error handling for the actor and FFI & Actor handler API
- @eike-hass: example snippets workflow / expectations
- @JelleMillenaar: IOTA Identity on IoT Hardware (ST, Intel, RFID) - C-bindings
- PublickeyBase58 removal / publicKeyJwk? 


## Circular Dependency (Preserve Order)
- Shared dependency with Identity
- Either serde_json & wasm-bindgen
- https://github.com/iotaledger/crypto.rs/pull/94 Root of the problem?

## Slow Debug version
- WASM unaffected atm
- Devin Link issue:
    - ~~https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/pull/480~~
    - [permanode support](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs/pull/586)

## publicKeyJwk
- JSON web signatures - Normalization non - JSON-LD

## Error handling - Nested Enums
- Only C-style enums possible with FFI
- Needs to be serializable 
- Struct with ErrorCodes linked to String descriptions
- 2 integers (Inner and outer) + Descriptions
