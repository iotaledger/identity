DID resolution is the process of fetching and decoding a [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) corresponding to a given [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers).
The [IOTA Identity framework](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) supports resolving DID Documents that are stored on Shimmer networks (public or private),
and the IOTA Tangle once it updated.

This is similar to, but not to be confused with, the [W3C DID Resolution specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/), which
defines function signatures for resolution more in the context of web or REST API resolution, whereas the IOTA Identity framework
provides strongly-typed resolution for better developer experience.

This functionality is primarily provided by the `Resolver`, which can:
- [Resolve DID Documents across multiple networks](#resolving-a-did).
- Resolve an issuer's DID Document given a [verifiable credential](#resolution-for-verifiable-presentations).
- Resolve the holder and issuer DID Documents referenced in a [verifiable presentation](#resolution-for-verifiable-presentations).

## Resolving a DID

The following examples demonstrates how to resolve the DID: `did:iota:rms:0xe4edef97da1257e83cbeb49159cfdd2da6ac971ac447f233f8439cf29376ebfe`,
which is from the Shimmer testnet.

### Resolver

The `Resolver` follows the read procedure defined in the [IOTA DID Method Specification](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec.md),
to extract and validate the DID Document in the latest [Alias Output](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#alias-output)
from the network specified in the DID (here `rms` is the Bech32-HRP for the Shimmer testnet, see [DID Format](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#did-format)).
If the `Resolver` was not configured with a client for the given network, an error is thrown.

TODO: add example code.

### Client

The `Client` can also be used directly to resolve individual DIDs from the network for which it is configured.

    let document: StardustDocument = client.resolve_did(&did).await.unwrap();
}

## Resolution for Verifiable Presentations

When validating [verifiable presentations](../verifiable_credentials/verifiable_presentations.mdx),
it is necessary to resolve the DID Documents of the [verifiable credential](../verifiable_credentials/overview.md)
issuers and presentation holder to verify their signatures. Resolving the necessary DID Documents is performed automatically
when verifying presentations via the `Resolver::verify_presentation` method (see the following [example](../verifiable#example)).

When direct access to these DID Documents is desired, the `Resolver` also provides standalone methods to:
- Resolve a presentation holder's DID Document.
- Resolve the DID Documents of the issuers of the credentials in a verifiable presentation.
- Resolve the issuer's DID Document for a given verifiable credential.

## Complete example
This section shows a full example from the IOTA Identity Framework codebase.

The example creates a DID Document, publishes it to the Tangle and then resolves it.
