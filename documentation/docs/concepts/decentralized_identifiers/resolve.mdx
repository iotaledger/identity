DID resolution is the process of fetching and decoding a [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) corresponding to a given [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). The [IOTA Identity framework](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) supports resolving DID Documents that are stored on the IOTA and Shimmer networks.

This is similar to, but not to be confused with, the [W3C DID Resolution specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/), which defines function signatures for resolution in the context of web or REST APIs, whereas the IOTA Identity framework provides strongly-typed resolution for a better developer experience.

This functionality is primarily provided by the `Resolver`, which can:
- [Resolve DID Documents across multiple networks](#resolving-a-did).
- [Resolve the DID Documents referenced in a verifiable presentation or credential](#resolution-for-verifiable-presentations).

## Resolving a DID

The following examples demonstrate how to resolve an IOTA DID Document from its DID.

### Resolver

The `Resolver` follows the read procedure defined in the [IOTA DID Method Specification](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec.md#read). It fetches the latest [Alias Output](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#alias-output) from the network specified in the DID (see [DID Format](../../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#did-format)), then extracts and validates the DID Document from it.

Multiple networks can be supported by a `Resolver` simply by adding multiple clients to it, each using a node endpoint for a different network.

  resolver.attach_iota_handler(client);

const document = await resolver.resolve(did);
```

### Client

The `Client` can also be used directly, to resolve individual DIDs from its configured network.

#[tokio::main]

  // Configure a client for the Shimmer testnet "rms".
  let node_url = "https://api.testnet.shimmer.network/";
  let client = Client::builder()
    .with_primary_node(node_url, None)

const client = new Client({

const didClient = new IotaIdentityClient(client);

// Parse the DID and resolve its DID Document.
const did = IotaDID.parse("did:iota:rms:0x7b48b06232b8a1e7a31c314cab1ceedb84e2e9dd2b1fae79b67eaa4595f15e47");
const document = await didClient.resolveDid(did);

## Resolution for Verifiable Presentations

When validating [verifiable presentations](../verifiable_credentials/verifiable_presentations.mdx), it is necessary to resolve the DID Documents of the [verifiable credential](../verifiable_credentials/overview.md) issuers and presentation holder to verify their signatures. Resolving the necessary DID Documents is performed automatically when verifying presentations via the `Resolver` (see this [example](../verifiable_credentials/verifiable_presentations.mdx#example)).

When direct access to these DID Documents is desired, the `Resolver` also provides standalone methods to:
- Resolve a presentation holder's DID Document.
- Resolve the DID Documents of the issuers of the credentials in a verifiable presentation.
- Resolve the issuer's DID Document for a given verifiable credential.

## Example
The following example creates a new IOTA DID, publishes it and then resolves its DID Document and Alias Output.
