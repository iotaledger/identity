DID resolution is the process of obtaining a [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) corresponding to a given [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers). 
The [IOTA Identity Framework](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) supports resolving DID Documents that are stored on an IOTA Tangle (public or private). The main tool supplied 
by the IOTA Identity Framework to handle DID Document Resolution in a type safe manner is the `Resolver`. 


## Resolving a DID from the main network

The following example demonstrates how to resolve the DID: "did:iota:H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV" from the `main` network.

```rust
use identity::iota::Resolver; 
use identity::iota_core::IotaDID;
use identity::iota::ResolvedIotaDocument; 

let resolver: Resolver = Resolver::new().await?; 
let did: IotaDID = IotaDID::parse("did:iota:H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV")?;

let doc: ResolvedIotaDocument = resolver.resolve(&did).await?; 

```

<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const {
    DID,
    Resolver,
    ResolvedDocument,
} = require('@iota/identity-wasm/node');

 const resolver = new Resolver();
 const did = DID.parse("did:iota:H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV");
 const doc = await resolver.resolve(did);

```
</TabItem>

The technical details of how resolution exactly works in terms of querying the Tangle is explained in the [IOTA DID Method Specification](./../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#read). 

## Resolving from a private tangle 
Resolving a DID from a private tangle is similar to resolving a DID from the main net. The only difference is that 
the resolver needs to be configured to have a client capable of operating on said private tangle. Building a Client configured for a specified Tangle is explained in this [example in Rust](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/dev/examples/low-level-api/private_tangle.rs) and this [example in Javascript](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/dev/bindings/wasm/examples/src/private_tangle.js).

The following example demonstrates how one can setup a `Resolver` with a given `client` and then attempt resolving a specified `did` which may be on any Tangle (public or private). 
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Rust" label="Rust">

```rust 
use identity::iota::Resolver;
use identity::iota::ResolverBuilder;  
use identity::iota_core::IotaDID;
use identity::iota::Client;
use identity::iota::Result; 


async fn resolve_from_private_tangle(client: Client, did: IotaDID) -> Result<ResolvedIotaDocument> {
    let resolver: Resolver = ResolverBuilder.new().client(client).build().await?;
    resolver.resolve(did).await
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const {
    DID,
    Resolver,
    ResolvedDocument,
    Client, 
} = require('@iota/identity-wasm/node');


async function resolveFromPrivateTange(client, did) {
        const resolver = await Resolver.builder().client(client).build();
        const resolvedDocument = await resolver.resolve(did);
        return resolvedDocument;
}

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the example above the resolver will automatically try to resolve the DID from the network specified in the `did` (See [DID Format](./../specs/did/iota_did_method_spec#did-format)). 
If the resolver was not built with a client configured for the given network name then an error will be thrown. Note that the `ResolverBuilder` can configure the `Resolver` to use as 
many networks as you wish as long as they have distinct valid names (max six characters). 

## Resolution in the context of Verifiable Presentations 
As explained in [Verifiable Presentations](./../verifiable_credentials/verifiable_presentations) one resolves the DID Documents of the credential issuers and presentation holder 
during verification of a verifiable presentation. Resolving the necessary DID Documents is done automatically when verifying presentations via the `Resolver`, but there are certain 
advanced use cases where more control is desired. To accommodate for such situations the `Resolver` also comes equipped with additional stand alone methods that enable:
- resolving a holders DID Document, 
- resolving all DID Documents of the distinct issuers of the credentials of credentials in the presentation,
- resolving the issuer's DID Document for a given verifiable credential
