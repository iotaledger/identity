TODO: Explain how DID Documents can be manipulated and how updates should be published.

## Example

This example shows how you can add more to an existing DID Document. The two main things you can add are Verification Methods and Services. A verification method adds public keys, which can be used to digitally sign things like an identity. The services provide metadata around the identity via URIs. These can be URLs, but also emails or IOTA indices.

### Account Module (Recommended)

<CodeSnippet 
    nodeReplitLink="https://repl.it/@IOTAFoundation/manipulate-did?lite=true"
    rustContent={account_manipulate_did_rs}
    nodeGithubLink = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/dev/bindings/wasm/examples-account/src/manipulate_did.ts"
    rustGithubLink = "https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/dev/examples/account/manipulate_did.rs"
/>
