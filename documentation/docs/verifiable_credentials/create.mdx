A verifiable credential can represent all information that a phisical [credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential) represents (i.e a set of one or more claims made by an issuer. However, by allowing other parties to cryptographically verify the authorship of the credential, a VC can be seen as more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts. 

In the IOTA Identity Framework you can create a Verifiable Credential with the following properties:

- [**ID**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#identifiers): optional URI identifier for the credential.
- [**Types**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#types): list of types describing the credential. Includes `"VerifiableCredential"` by default.
- [**Subject**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject): a set of objects that contain one or more properties that are each related to a subject.
- [**Issuer**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer): a URI or an object containing the ID of the issuer.

- [**Context**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts): list of JSON-LD context URIs. Includes `"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"` by default.
- [**Issuance Date**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuance-date): optional timestamp for expressing the date and time when a credential becomes valid. 
- [**Expiration Date**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#expiration): optional timestamp for expressing the date and time when a credential ceases to be valid.
- [**Status**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status): optional ID and Type used to determine the current status of a credential.
- [**Schema**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#data-schemas): optional list of objects specifying the ID and Type of the schema that the data must conform to. 
- [**Refresh Service**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#refreshing): optional link to a service where the recipient may refresh the included credentials.
- [**Terms of Use**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terms-of-use): optional list of policies defining obligations, prohibitions, or permissions of the presentation recipient.
- [**Evidence**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#evidence): optional list of objects specifying a Type that can be used by the issuer to provide the verifier with additional supporting information in a verifiable credential. 
- [**Non Transferable**](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#nontransferable-property): optional flag that indicates that a verifiable credential must only be encapsulated into a verifiable presentation whose proof was issued by the credentialSubject.

After creation, the issuer signs the verifiable credential using a private key, which will allow verifiers to validate the VC with its public key.

### Proof Options {#proof-options}

A digital signature on a verifiable credential both provides data integrity and proves the DID of the issuer.
The proof section embedded in a credential may also include additional metadata.

The following metadata properties can be configured by the framework and are optional and omitted by default:

- **Created**: timestamp of when the credential was signed.
- **Expires**: timestamp after which the credential is no longer considered valid.
- **Challenge**: arbitrary random string. Sent by the issuer and mitigates replay attacks; should be sufficiently random and uniquely generated per credential request.
- **Domain**: arbitrary string. Sent by the issuer and can help mitigate replay attacks when used with a challenge.
- **Proof Purpose**: indicates the purpose of the signature.
  - **AssertionMethod**: to assert a claim. The signing verification method must have an [`assertionMethod`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#assertion) relationship to be valid.
  - **Authentication**: to authenticate the signer. The signing verification method must have an [`authentication`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#authentication) relationship to be valid.

### Credential Validation {#credential-validation}

Both issuers and holders of verifiable credentials might be interested in making sure certain properties of the VC are valid, specially right after creating or receiving a VC, but this checks can be done at any point in time and can be a useful way of making sure the VC has not been revoked. 

The Iota Framework allows issuers and holders to perform some validations using the CredentialValidator.

The following checks can be verified by the validator:

- **Credential proofs**: verifies the credential signatures against the DID Documents of the issuer.
- **Semantic Validation**: ensures the credential adhere to the specification.
- **Subject Holder Relationship**: ensures that the credential relationship between the holder and the subject match.
- **Optional validations**: additional checks on signatures and credential fields can be configured.
- **Latest Issuance date**: check that the [`issuanceDate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuance-date) property, if present, is not after a specific datetime. Defaults to the current datetime if unset.
- **Earliest Expiry date**: check that the [`expirationDate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#expiration) property, if present, is not before a specific datetime. Defaults to the current datetime if unset.

The last two checks listed above are specified using CredentialValidationOptions.

### Sharing Verifiable Credentials {#sharing-verifiable-credentials}

A verifiable presentation is the recommended data format for sharing one or more verifiable credentials. The next section explains [verifiable presentations](./verifiable_presentations.mdx) in more detail.

## Example

The following code exemplifies how an issuer can create, sign, and validate a verifiable credential. In this example, the issuer signs a UniversityDegreeCredential with Alice's name and DID. 
This Verifiable Credential can be [verified by anyone](./verifiable_presentations.mdx), allowing Alice to take control of it and share it with anyone.
