TODO: Explain how Verifiable Credentials are revoked using `credentialStatus` and e.g. `RevocationList2020`.

## Example

This example shows how you can revoke a [Verifiable Credential(VC)](overview) by removing a verification method (public key) from the DID Document of the Issuer. This means the VC can no longer be validated. This would invalidate every VC signed with the same public key, meaning the Issuer would have to sign every VC with a different key.
