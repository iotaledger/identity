#### DIDDocument
- 3 ways to read DIDDocument 
    - from tangle (unmut var)
    - Stronghold (mut var)
    - create a new document
- GetJSONDIDDocument -> good for interoperability  
- Agnostig encryption
    - allows third party encryption (ProofTypeManager) - (nice to have)

#### DIDPublisher
- JSON DIDDoc in the Tangle (GetJSONDIDDocument)
    - Based on MAM
    - Future Discussion for the Publisher
        - IOTA Streams
        - Custom Transactions

**Improvement Ideas**
- Split DID writer and reader
- Statebadges (like git, just track changes of the DID Document - not the entire document)
    -> Stronghold uses a versioned database, could be solved with that.

#### Verifiable Credentials
- 2 ways to create a Credential
    - Create
    - read from json (DecodeFromJSON)
- Schemas
    - Idea for future: Schema Catalog with update
- SchemaManager
    - DoesObjectFollowSchema - using lib to check valid JSON schema

- order is important for signature
    - alphabetical order
