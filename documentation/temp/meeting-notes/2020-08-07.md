# 🗓️ Whiteboard Meeting: Identity Transaction Structure Discussion - 2020-08-07

### 🎯 Goals
* Linking DID - Address - Keys
* Streams vs Custom Transactions
* State patches vs Full Documents


### 💬 Discussion topics

* IOTA Streams Performance
    * No tests

* Streams Sequencing
    * You can't falsify Update messages as non-writer

* IOTA Streams Requirement
    * Share Public key off-tangle

* Streams 
    * Ownership rotation possible via custom message types

* Streams Libraries can be reused in parts?
    * Needs to be worked on

* Corner case: Conflicting messages on same Index: Ordering through timestamps -> Requirement towards engineering? 


* Custom transaction seems the way forward

* Human readable friendly identifiers are impossible if we do public key - > DID -> Address
    * Hash(Plaintext) = ID -> Owner

* Encryption of DID Documents does not prevent any attack vectors
    * It does slow down validation
    * Identity payload data type validation becomes impossible
    * Validate formatting
    * In general: Spam becomes worse

* State patches vs Full Documents
    * Auth chain with with full documents
    * DIF chain for each document on auth chain if address != 0 

### Conclusions

* Linking DID - Address - Public Key
    * Address = Hash(DID) -> Allows finding of DID Document from DID
    * DID = Hash(PublicKey) -> Fixed format DID which ownership can be proven from
    * DID = Hash(Plaintext) -> Non-secure identity for objects to store information. This is out of scope for now

* IOTA Streams vs Custom Transactions
    * We decided to go with Custom Transactions.
    * Streams provides little to no advantages and does add restrictions.
    * Will try to share some of Stream's libraries / logic.

* Encrypting Transactions does not add any privacy protection

* State patches vs Full Documents
    * Decided to do both
    * DIV Chain
        * State patches for the DID Document
        * Can update any field besides authentication keys.
    * Authentication Chain
        * A chain of Full DID Documents that rotate authentication keys. 
        * Every new transactions creates a new DIV Chain.
        * Optimized DID Doc validation as old DIV Chains can be skipped.

*This example would just query the Authentication Address, validate the 3 transactions and query DIV Chain Addr 3, skipping validation of DIV Chain Addr 1 & 2*
