- Refactor resolver code and add better error handling
- Finish DID Dereferncing
- Sign credentials

## Diffing Format/Logic 
 - Should we use serde-diff or our own lib? @JelleMillenaar expressed concerns about the size of the diff JSON; a home built lib would give us more control over such things.

## DID Fragments

Question: How to check the format? Is there a standard for [fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#fragment)?

There are different format of fragments, to get a public key.
- keys-1 (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#example-5)
- public-key-1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#example-11)


 Answer: The fragment `keys-1` sould be a name (or key) for the connected value. 
 - The fragment names should be unique.
 - Each fragment need to have an name/key

Question: Do we check for name uniqueness and throw an error?

Answer: It's complicated. Let's discuss this in the next meeting or add an whitboard meeting. ([issue here](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/issues/29))

## Hash function
Which hash function do we use for the DID itself?
- Blake2b
- What are the advantages and disadvantages to use Blake2b?
