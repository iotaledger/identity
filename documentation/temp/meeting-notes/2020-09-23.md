## üôã‚Äç Standup

### ‚è™ What was last week's progress?
- Prepared DIDComm envelope for encryption and signing DIDComm Messages
- Finished Diff Macro and Core API.  Started working on Account Module (Some Blockers in place though)
- Lots of discussions with Stronghold
- Few small resolver and ledger integration updates, did creation, looked into DIDComm
- JSON Web Tokens. Discussions regarding Stronghold and crypto crates. Misc. OpenID topics

### ‚è© What will be the focus for this week?
- Discover DIDComm Message semantics (body specification)

## üí¨ Discussion topics
- LD-Proofs vs JWT
- [Encryption and signing in DIDComm](https://hackmd.io/@WZdHn6o0TmiYck3zlENRsw/SJiFBDwSD/edit)
- Stronghold/Account Module Blockers & Core/Diff/Macro PR. 
- Stronghold crypto: Temp Crypto or Support Stronghold?
- Wen FFI
- Highlevel libraries

### New library: crypto.rs
A shared library for cryptography stuff within in the IF. 

### LD-Proofs vs JWT
The VC spec describes LD-Proofs and JWT, which have the same result.

> identity.rs supports both.

JWT > LD-Proofs
- JWT is more adopted. 
- LD-Proofs is more a concept, which has no adoption right now.

> Focus on JWT.

### Encryption and signing in DIDComm

[libjose](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/feat/siop-did/libjose) library within the identity.rs project.

Peer2peer transportation layer does the encryption. 

:::info
DIDComm should focus on message semantics.

PoC by Elena - Agent to agent communication

### Stronghold/Account Module Blockers & Core/Diff/Macro PR. 

Stronghold.rs is a blocker right now.

Devin helps on crypto.rs
Tensor helps on Stronghold.rs

### Wen FFI

We could start right now, but we need to calculate  a lot of overhead.

When do we start with the FFI implementation?
> After code stabilization

:::√¨nfo
**Focus:**
- WASM (Javascript)

### Highlevel libraries

Low level libs: 
> low level libs are (in general not used by external developers)

- identity.rs
- crypto.rs

High level lib:
> High level libs are for external devs

TODO: method planning (we need a spec)

## ‚ùì Questions

Q1: Should we use Stronghold for encryption and signing in DIDComm or use rust crypto  crates?
A1: We **should** use Stronghold (specifically crypto.rs) but functionality is lacking so use rust crypto crates for now. Eventually all crypto will be provided by crypto.rs

Q2: Whats the progress of Stronghold encryption and signing? 
A2: **Very** early stages
