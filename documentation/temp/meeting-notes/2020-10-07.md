## 🙋‍ Standup

### ⏪ What was last week's progress?
- Add Trusted Ping as DIDComm Message to p2p PoC. 
- Extend WASM Module with core structure.
- @l1h3r: Add signature algorithms to `crypto.rs`. Update `libjose` to use `crypto.rs`. Start working on crate organization/cleanup
- @Thoralf Create Ed25519 signatures and sign/verify documents with DID from auth key
- @tensor: Fixed the compression algorithm and worked on various experimental memory/file caching methods.
- @JelleMillenaar: Worked on DID Method Spec & High level library
- @elenaf9: Implemented a mailbox for p2p communication that enables communication by sending key-value records to a server that then puts them into it's kademlia dht


### ⏩ What will be the focus this week?
- @l1h3r: Finish crate organization. Update resolver/tangle IO to use generic traits.
- Finish TrustPing Message
- Create example with signed did document

## 💬 Discussion topics
- DID Comm / Agents? 
- Feature: Deactivate Identity?
- Feature: Credential Revocation
- Clean PR's
- WASM vs Javascript bindings?
- How to flag when to use diff
- Team Identity Stream

### DID Comm / Agents? 
- PoC Fork: https://github.com/huhn511/iota-p2p-poc
- More discussion about TrustedPing and Mailbox (@elenaf9, @nothingismagick, @huhn511)

**DIDComm Messages:**
Routing,
Connections,
Notification,
Signature,
CredentialIssuance,
ReportProblem,
PresentProof,
TrustPing,
DiscoveryFeatures,
Basicmessage,
Unknown(String)

### Feature: Deactivate Identity?
The latest DID entry in the chain need to be empty ( empty = signet DIDDocument, no public key, no endpoints, ... ).

-> functionality to high level lib.

TODO: Write an example about this

### Credential Revocation

:::warning
This is a important topic.
:::
Example: Revoke a driver license

### Clean PR's
**will be discussed in the next meeting**

### WASM vs Javascript bindings
**will be discussed in the next meeting**
[WASM/JS Example](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/blob/Feat(bindings)/add-wasm-binding/libraries/wasm/examples/web.js)


## ❓ Questions

### Question #1
Q1: DIDComm Body.

This is valid:
```json=
body: { key: "foo" } 
```

Is this valid? 

```json=

body: "foo" 
```

A1: This is not valid. The body need to be a object: [The body of a message – everything inside the body **object**](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/)

-----
### Question #2

Q2: We discovered the repo and figured out, that we have 2 different code styles to build structs and use the library. Sould we focus for one style or support both?

@tensor -> preference towards `the builder pattern` if we use macros to generate the builder and the associated methods. 

#### Init
```rust=
 let did = DID {
        method_name: "iota".into(),
        id_segments: vec!["123456".into()],
        ..Default::default()
    }
    .init()
    .unwrap();
```

#### Builder
```rust=
let credential = CredentialBuilder::new()
        .issuer("did:example:issuer")
        .context("https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1")
        .context(object!(id: "did:context:1234", type: "CustomContext2020"))
        .id("did:example:123")
        .type_("RelationshipCredential")
        .try_subject(object!(id: "did:iota:alice", spouse: "did:iota:bob"))
        .unwrap()
        .try_subject(object!(id: "did:iota:bob", spouse: "did:iota:alice"))
        .unwrap()
        .issuance_date(issuance)
        .build()
        .unwrap();
```
