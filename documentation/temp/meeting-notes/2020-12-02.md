### Beta
Missing Modules:

### Setup-DIDComm Branch

The [Setup-DIDComm](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/26) has the following functionalities:

- DIDComm Messages (TrustPing, AuthMessage)
- identity Actor Demo (runs, but does nothing)
- General Docs

DIDComm is a hot topic at the moment and the Dezentral Identity Foundation (DIF) will release the standardization website soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. (didcomm.org)

The identtiy Team should set one developer to this topic, to bring the IOTA identity to an DIDComm standart asap.

Open Tasks:

- Check and discuss DIDComm Envelop
- Implement Missing DIDComm Messages
- Discuss usage of Actor (DIDComm should be transport agnostic)
    - Identity Actor
    - Stronghold Actor
- Discuss Agent crate (like bee usage with cli and server)
    - IOTA Cloud Agent (Http)
