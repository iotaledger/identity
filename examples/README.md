## IOTA Identity Examples

The following code examples demonstrate how to use IOTA Identity.

### Prerequisites

Examples can be run against
- a local IOTA node
- or an existing network, e.g. the IOTA testnet

When setting up the local node, you'll also need to publish an identity package as described in
[Local Network Setup](https://docs.iota.org/iota-identity/getting-started/local-network-setup) in the documentation portal.
You'll also need to provide an environment variable `IOTA_IDENTITY_PKG_ID` set to the package-id of your locally deployed
identity package, to be able to run the examples against the local node.
If running the examples on `testnet`, use the `IOTA_IDENTITY_PKG_ID` `0x222741bbdff74b42df48a7b4733185e9b24becb8ccfbafe8eac864ab4e4cc555`.

In case of running the examples against an existing network, this network needs to have a faucet to fund your accounts (the IOTA testnet (`https://api.testnet.iota.cafe`) supports this), and you need to specify this via `API_ENDPOINT`.

The examples require you to have the node you want to use in the iota clients "envs" (`iota client env`) configuration, as the client is used to request funds from the configured network's faucet.

### Environment variables

Summarizing the last point, you'll need one or more of the following environment variables:

| Name                 | Required for local node | Required for testnet | Required for other node |
| -------------------- | :---------------------: | :------------------: | :---------------------: |
| IOTA_IDENTITY_PKG_ID |            x            |          x           |            x            |
| API_ENDPOINT         |                         |          x           |            x            |

### Running examples

Run an example using the following command, environment variables depend on your setup, see [Environment variables](#environment-variables).

```bash
IOTA_IDENTITY_PKG_ID=0x222741bbdff74b42df48a7b4733185e9b24becb8ccfbafe8eac864ab4e4cc555 cargo run --example <example-name>
```

For instance, to run the `0_create_did` example with the following (environment variables depend on you setup, see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)):

```bash
IOTA_IDENTITY_PKG_ID=0x222741bbdff74b42df48a7b4733185e9b24becb8ccfbafe8eac864ab4e4cc555 cargo run --release --example 0_create_did
```
