/// An interface for Account storage implementations.
///
/// The [`Storage`] interface is used for secure key operations, such as key generation and signing,
/// as well as key-value like storage of data structures, such as DID documents.
///
/// # Identifiers
///
/// Implementations of this interface are expected to uniquely identify keys through the
/// combination of DID _and_ `KeyLocation`.
///
/// An implementation recommendation is to use the DID as a partition key. Everything related to a DID
/// can be stored in a partition identified by that DID. Keys belonging to a DID can then be identified
/// by [`KeyLocation`]s in that partition.
///
/// # DID List
///
/// The storage is expected to maintain a list of stored DIDs. DIDs created with `did_create` should be
/// inserted into the list, and removed when calling `did_purge`.
/// Other operations on the list are `did_exists` and `did_list`.
///
/// # Thread-Safety
///
/// Note: This only applies if the `send-sync-storage` feature is enabled.
///
/// Since the DID list is a global data structure per storage instance, modifications to that list
/// need to be carefully synchronized.
/// Other operations can be executed concurrently and don't need to be synchronized globally,
/// as it is a user error to create more than one `Account` for the same identity.
/// Regardless of that, a storage implementation still needs to be thread-safe as defined by
/// the `Send` and `Sync` traits.
///
/// # Implementation example
///
/// See [`MemStore`][crate::storage::MemStore] for a test/example implementation.
