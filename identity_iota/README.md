> [!NOTE]
> This version of the library is compatible with IOTA Rebased networks and in active development, for a version of the library compatible with IOTA Stardust networks check [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/support/v1.5)

## Introduction

IOTA Identity is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementation of decentralized digital identity, also known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). It implements the W3C [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specifications. This library can be used to create, resolve and authenticate digital identities and to create verifiable credentials and presentations in order to share information in a verifiable manner and establish trust in the digital world. It does so while supporting secure storage of cryptographic keys, which can be implemented for your preferred key management system. Many of the individual libraries (Rust crates) are agnostic over the concrete DID method, with the exception of some libraries dedicated to implement the [IOTA DID method](https://docs.iota.org/references/iota-identity/iota-did-method-spec/), which is an implementation of decentralized digital identity on IOTA Rebased networks. Written in stable Rust, IOTA Identity has strong guarantees of memory safety and process integrity while maintaining exceptional performance.
